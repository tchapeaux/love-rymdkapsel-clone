# TODO

## Features

[ ] Add the Enemy
[ ] Add Deposits
[ ] UI for Minion Scheduler
[ ] Room Selector and Prioritizer (UI?)
[ ] Many more :)

## Behavior

[ ] Add a function checking if a floating room is in a valid position and use it in `Spacebase.placeFloatingRoom`
[ ] Finish Extractor behavior
[ ] Finish Quarters behavior

## Look & feel

[ ] Room outlines
[ ] Star field
[ ] Item assets (vectorial? in-engine?)
[ ] Sounds

## Refactoring

[ ] Make View part of the UI
[ ] Make `Spacebase.updateNeighbors` use the @rooms instead of exhaustively searching the whole grid
[ ] Find a name for a Room method like `required[res] == current[res]` (then implement it then use it)
[ ] Encapsulate the different UI components
